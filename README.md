This application is created for test purposes for SunCorp created by Wael

The application fetches data from a network url which receives a json file.

The application implements an MVVM design pattern which will read the json returned and renders the data in a nicely designed UI.

The UI uses a UITableView displays a list of all expensed and at the bottom displays the sum of all expenses. The expenses are ordered by
effective date in a descending order so the most recent date is at the top.

The app UI supports different device orientation.

The UI implements AutoLayouts as well as VFL (Visual Format Language) to help set up constraints programmatically

Implemented a unit test to test the network connectivity.

please run pod update. I integrated AlamoFire but didn't really use it. I wanted to show that I can integrate pod libraries. You may need to update the project settings so you don't see any warnings. There should be zero warnings in the app.

If there are any issues with the project please feel free to email me on wael.saad@hotmail.com or contact me on 0433 597 200

I am a very passionate iOS developer and I am really keen to join SunCorp team if there is an oppurtunity to do so.

Thank you
